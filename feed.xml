<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main inspiration of the suffering abolition group is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pearce_(transhumanist)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">David Pearce</a>’s work on the topic. For many years he has been writing about and advocating for strategies to eradicate suffering in all sentient life. The abolition of suffering, he claims, is ambitious, but technically feasible. He continues: “Genetic engineering and nanotechnology allow Homo sapiens to discard the legacy-wetware of our evolutionary past. Our post-human successors will rewrite the vertebrate genome, redesign the global ecosystem, and abolish suffering throughout the living world.” (Pearce 1995) </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initiatives aiming to facilitate the eventual abolition of suffering can aim towards the goal directly or indirectly. Indirect initiatives would be such that build a scientific, educational and cultural foundation to help getting more direct interventions off the ground.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First I mounted a ‘</span><strong>Disclaimer’ </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">or intro box to the mindmap, indicating the purpose of the mind map, my professional background and my professional perspective on the topics.  </span></p>
<p><strong>In it, it says: </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mind map was developed to give an overview on suffering cause areas and presumably most effective interventions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The map should help aspiring suffering abolitionists to find their own niche of engagement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And although my understanding comes from my education in Biology (B.Sc.) and Social Science (B.A.), as well as personal research, I am not an expert in all these topics. Therefore, I hope to ongoingly incorporate new insights, and discuss the maps with members of the scientific community in order to improve the framework. </span></p>

<p><strong>Let's define Suffering: </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When talking about suffering, what I mean by it is a desperate feeling coming from an extreme urge to stop an ongoing experience. It includes the following aspects:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Strong aversion to the experience</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- A perceived inability to avoid the experience</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(this includes the inability to focus on positive aspects of the experience such as a potential reward, lesson or achievement)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Subsequently, high stress level, often marked physiologically by fight, flight or freeze response</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <strong>ability to suffer</strong> depends on the ability to model a sense of experience and preference.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to my knowledge this requires a centralised computation system. By this understanding, the potential to suffer is plausible not just for <span style="color: #bad5d5;">human</span> and <span style="color: #afc7d8;">non-human </span>animals, but also for <span style="color: #e1991d;">digital sentience</span> as well as <span style="color: #a087b3;">extraterrestrial sentience</span>. </span></p>
<figure class="post__image"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://Suffering-Abolition.github.io/media/posts/2/4_Website_Mindmap_Numbers.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://Suffering-Abolition.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/4_Website_Mindmap_Numbers-xs.png 300w ,https://Suffering-Abolition.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/4_Website_Mindmap_Numbers-sm.png 480w ,https://Suffering-Abolition.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/4_Website_Mindmap_Numbers-md.png 768w ,https://Suffering-Abolition.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/4_Website_Mindmap_Numbers-lg.png 1024w ,https://Suffering-Abolition.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/4_Website_Mindmap_Numbers-xl.png 1360w ,https://Suffering-Abolition.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/4_Website_Mindmap_Numbers-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="" width="90" height="96"></figure></span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #ba8484;"><strong>Forms of suffering - internal cause areas</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, internal cause areas of suffering and different forms of suffering will be explored, based on understanding of human and non-human animals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first association and many other definitions of suffering are based on <strong>pain</strong>, and specifically physical pain. Pain has many different subcategories, which are all associated with physical injury due to internal physical malfunctions or due to outer forces such as ecological and environmental conditions or infectious diseases. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between physical pain and mental pain there is a subsection of </span><strong>chemical imbalance in the brain and general brain malfunctioning</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I will not address the functionality of physical pain much more since it is comparably easy to understand intuitively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More common than chemical imbalance in the brain and general brain malfunctioning, and yet less intuitively understood with their causal mechanisms than physical pain are mental pain responses, and subsequent mental health issues. Contrary to common intuitions, they seem to all come from </span><strong>unmet needs</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. To keep this part brief, I will restrain myself from going into the psychological mechanisms that alter our perception of mental discomfort and its causal factors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I categorised these needs into the following categories and subcategories:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Safety</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> associated needs, including</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the need for one’s </span><strong>own physical and mental safety</strong></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the need for the safety of </span><strong>valued things and entities</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">and the need for </span><strong>moral coherence and justice</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Physiological or self maintenance needs / feelings</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, like</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>hunger, thirst, breathing, and benign climate conditions</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appropriate </span><strong>stimulation level</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A lack of stimulation creates boredom and depression, and overstimulation induces overwhelm and even fear for safety. The stimulation homeostasis is required </span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">on a </span><strong>social, romantic and sexual stimulation level </strong></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">on perceived </span><strong>coherence </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">of experiences, including </span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="3"><strong>comprehensibility</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of experiences. The notion of things happening in an orderly and predictable fashion and a sense that you can understand events in your life.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The notion that one has the skills or ability, the support, the help, or the resources necessary to take care of things, and that things are </span><strong>manageable</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and within one’s control.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="3">And the notion that one’s experiences, decisions and impact are <strong>meaningful </strong>and otherwise satisfactory.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">on the </span><strong>self actualisation</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> level there are the need for self expression and <strong>a</strong></span><strong>esthetic preferences</strong></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">and on the </span><strong>esteem</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> level there is a need for </span><strong>recognition and validation of one's self</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, one’s self-image and one’s experiences as well as of one’s </span><strong>accomplishments</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #aac78b;"><strong>Interventions for internal cause areas </strong><strong>- </strong><strong>Change of internal processes leading to suffering</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to abolish suffering on an internal cause level, interventions have to change internal processes leading to suffering. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most sustainable interventions would be </span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><strong>Pre-birth genetic alteration</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: </span>e.g. raised hedonic setpoint, <span style="font-weight: 400;">enhanced conscious ability of emotional control, pain tolerance, compassion, open-mindedness, social skilfulness, etc.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><strong>Sentience prevention</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">External factors that change internal processes would be</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Creating individualised optimal conditions for all sentient beings. This would only be possible through virtual reality, as the needs of beings are too diverse and thus conflicting with each other, leading to violation of some preferences either way, if conditions are optimised for any one preference system. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A much less radical and thus less effective and sustainable approach would be </span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li aria-level="3"><strong>Sociological / cultural optimisation towards welfare for all sentient beings</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li aria-level="3"><strong>Optimised education and training for rational thinking, life-skills, resilience and compassion</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A major sustainability issue here is, if not combined with genetic interventions, that natural genetic diversification without selection pressure results in functionality decay that eventually can’t be compensated with external factors, such as education and welfare. Unfortunately, a common misconception is that genetic decay takes anywhere near as many generations as genetic adaptations with ‘gain of function mutations’. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is, however, a very understandable reason behind avoiding this topic, as it may conjure up horrendous forms of eugenics and genocide on people with disabilities, as they happened in Nazi Germany and other parts of the world.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of acknowledging genetic factors as a source of privilege, people tend to value or devalue carriers for the presumable quality of their genes. I believe, however, avoiding or suppressing the topic altogether cannot be a response to the hatred against carriers of dysfunctional genes. Instead we should advocate for welfare that incorporates genetic engineering technologies as much as it includes classical medical care or social welfare.   </span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #ba8484;"><strong>External cause areas of suffering and potential interventions</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the next section external cause areas of suffering will be categorised, and specific interventions for these cause areas will be explored. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ba8484;"><strong>Exploitation</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exploitation has many forms. The first associations that come to mind are abuse and slavery. But parasitism and carnism can also be considered forms of exploitation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A newer form of exploitation is exploitation for information, known in the context of research on animals and potential digital sentience in the form of simulations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Humans can be considered the most important target group as they are the most powerful exploiters. One potential</span><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #aac78b;"> intervention</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> specific to humans, for example, is </span><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #aac78b;">education</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and training in compassion towards all sentient beings. To ensure considerations towards all sentient beings empathy, social sensitivity, attentiveness (awareness), emotional control and open-mindedness need to be established through education and in the long run also through genetic interventions, at least to counterbalance genetic decay (see category <span style="font-weight: 400; color: #ba8484;">Natural Evolution</span> below ). Education has its limits though, and can only build on existing genetic factors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, for non-human animals and human animals a more sustainable intervention would be </span><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #aac78b;">genetic reprogramming</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. To phase out exploitation we need to phase out survival dependency on exploitation - making all species physiologically independent from animal resources. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">G</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">enetic engineering could also be used for enhancing genetic factors contributing to increased compassionate and well considered behaviour among all animals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behaviour mostly follows perceived needs, much more than actual physical needs. This is something we can observe for example in people struggling to switch to a vegan diet, not because of health reasons but because of the struggle to change habits and resist desires. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People and other exploitative species need the capacity to acknowledge conflicting needs, and a stable desire to prevent suffering of all parties. Only then they are able in cases of conflicting needs to work on compromises instead of exploitation, destructive conflicts</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">or competition. Neurobiologically, the reward circuit response to the process and achievement of compromise needs to be stronger than the one for achieving profit at the costs of others. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Natural evolutionary processes give rise to selfish and tribal strategies, as well as more globally considered strategies. It is evident that selfish and tribal genetic adaptations have better short and medium term success rates. In order to establish a globally considered community genetic factors for strong positive reward circuit responses to the process and achievement of optimal outcomes for all sentient beings need to be widely spread. At the same time the pleasure in truth finding always has to outweigh the painfulness of facing unwanted truths. The neurobiological possibilities of education and training (re-conditioning) are powerful, but not able to phase out exploitation on their own.    </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, common arguments against reprogramming interventions are that ecological systems are just too complex and the sheer amount of involved sentient beings, especially if we assume at least some degree of sentience in insects. I agree with this, but also add that wild habitats are suffering hazards that should not exist. While genetic programming interventions need rigorous testing on a small scale, leaving hazardous environments uncared for is irresponsible, and life proliferation in those environments should be avoided as long as exploitation is the standard way of survival and until welfare of all sentient beings is feasible and implemented.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To prevent a sense of loss and increase support among humans (i.e. the one species of great influence), a <span style="font-weight: 400; color: #aac78b;">shift to controlled virtual existence</span> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">could compensate for the loss of nature in its raw and unmodified form. Non-sentient simulations there can be harmed and exploited in the usual ways, without causing real suffering. And if “mind uploading” could ever be possible, ensuring welfare and safety in those digital worlds should be much easier than welfare and safety for biological systems. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #ba8484;"><strong>Malevolence from others (intend to harm/create suffering)</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The desire to harm others, without creating immediate profit for oneself or others, can have many different causes: envy, unprocessed pain and trauma, feeling easily threatened due to lack of self worth, accepting a negative image and persona others projected onto you, showing off power over others, believing compassion to be a weakness and so on.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are important <span style="color: #aac78b;">interventions</span> to <span style="color: #aac78b;">prevent malevolence </span>such as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">identification and exclusion from powerful positions, rehabilitation and improved childcare. However, once again, in the long run these interventions should be combined with genetic interventions that eliminate risk factors for unhealthy emotional vulnerability and with genetic interventions that ensure genetic factors for compassion and emotional control.  </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ba8484;"><strong>Unintended Harm</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next category is</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> causing unintended harm. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(a) Harm is often done due to </span><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #ba8484;">discriminating moral circles</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, i.e. lack of empathy for other groups like beings outside one’s own family, circle of friends, ethnic group or species. Discriminating moral circles lead to ignorance when excluded sentient beings get negatively affected. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(b) There are also cognitive reasons for a <span style="color: #ba8484;">lack of empathy, compassion and understanding</span>. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Often enough good intentions are badly executed and create more harm than good.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(c) Lastly, significant harm can be caused by <span style="color: #ba8484;">corrupted 'good intentions' with ulterior motives</span>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good intentions can be corrupted by </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the desire to be needed, creating dependencies rather than solutions</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">caring more for the image gain or self esteem boost than the cause, leading to poorly developed solutions, intransparency and suppression of valid criticism </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">narcissistic needs and desires to control others (through paternalism, for example) </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Note that boosting one's motivation for altruistic projects by incorporating other needs is useful when done in a self-aware, reflected and balanced way.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #aac78b;">Interventions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> against unintended harm are again similar to those against exploitation and malevolence, based on </span><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #aac78b;">education</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #aac78b;"> </span>and </span><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #aac78b;">genetic interventions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #aac78b;">Educational approaches</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would contain training in rational and goal focussed thinking, self reflection and self awareness,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as well as reading and positively influencing sentience, and compassion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #aac78b;">Genetic reprogramming</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would involve enhancing genetic factors that facilitate the development of empathy, social sensitivity, scope sensitivity (awareness), emotional control, compassion and open-mindedness.  </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ba8484;"><strong>Natural Evolution</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next category is natural evolution. The way it causes suffering is through </span><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #ba8484;">excessive reproduction rates</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Excess of offspring and thus gene carriers is needed as a basis for selection processes. Which again only works in favour of evolutionary processes if most of the offspring lose the fight for survival. It is a game with a predetermined ever same goal: to secure the survival of at least part of the offspring. The evolution game has many victims and even ‘winning’ doesn’t mean safety and protection against suffering. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As <span style="color: #aac78b;">intervention</span> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">targeting the downsides of natural evolution needs to <span style="color: #aac78b;">reduce </span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #aac78b;">death and reproduction rates</span>. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The genetically imprinted desires that lead to reproduction need to be addressed (especially once death becomes avoidable through medical advances).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other part of natural evolution is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #ba8484;">gene-diversification through mutations and recombination</span>. Statistically only the tiniest minority of genetic alterations is expected to benefit the carrier, while the vast majority is either useless or harmful to it’s carrier. Therefore, any ‘gain-of-function’ mutation requires many victims with destructive genetic alterations, and disadvantages in the fight for survival. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A compassionate approach is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #aac78b;">replacing competitive evolutionary strategy with reproduction control and pre-birth genetic optimisation</span>. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most human societies have successfully fought the harsh selection conditions that are demanded for evolutionary progress. But unfortunately without addressing over-reproduction and constant gene diversification we are facing dead-end problems. In natural evolution gene diversification is needed to generate adaptability to an ever changing environment. Luckily, wealth and access to reproduction control have so far stabilised most human populations. But without addressing constant gene diversification we not just lose the ability to adapt and progress as a species, but are facing genetic decay. And genetic decay through loss of selection pressure is in fact a fast process. For reference see:</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #ba8484;">Environmental / Physical Factors</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Environmental / Physical Factors are another external cause of suffering. Particularly liable to suffering are extreme changes of environment, caused among other things by climate changes, as well as terrestrial and ecological shifts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such changes lead to both an <span style="color: #ba8484;">inability to adapt as an individual</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #ba8484;"> </span>and</span><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #ba8484;"> accidents. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if species or populations survive and recover from changes in the environment or are able to co-evolve with their sources of nutrition, their competitors, predators, parasites and infectious diseases, these ecological dynamics entail suffering and death for the majority of the involved individuals. In fact, for individuals even minor changes, like those of normal seasons, can be hard to compensate for and thus cause severe suffering. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To address the hardships of individuals, we need to establish<span style="color: #aac78b;"> </span></span><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #aac78b;">welfare for all sentient beings</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as well as </span><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #aac78b;">compassionate environment design</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #aac78b;"> </span>adapted to the needs of sentient ​​inhabitants. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ba8484;"><strong>Limit of Resources / Competition / Exceeded reproduction rate due to natural evolution</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At last, as already indicated in other categories, significant causes of suffering are<span style="color: #ba8484;"> </span></span><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #ba8484;">limited resources, competition and exceeding reproduction rates</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These causes are heavily interconnected and thus named together. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intuitive human response is </span><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #aac78b;">increasing efficiency of resource use and production</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But even technological advances in efficiency can not always compensate for the increase of demand due to population growth. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If possible, a </span><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #aac78b;">shift to virtual existence</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #aac78b;"> </span>with total control over resources could be a solution. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Otherwise </span><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #aac78b;">population control</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #aac78b;"> </span>through <span style="color: #aac78b;">fertility reduction</span> is necessary to reduce competition and overuse of resources. Also <span style="color: #aac78b;">reduction of habitats with uncontrolled life proliferation</span> might be worth considering as long as feasibility and capacity of welfare is limited. </span></p>

<p><strong>About Interventions</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note that intervention when implemented naively can easily cause severe counter effects!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cause areas need to be well understood to target the real cause, and not indicators of a cause.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interventions need to be well thought through with thorough assessment of potential intermediate and long-term outcomes (incl. side-effects) and impact.</span></p>

                <h2>How about we abolish suffering?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The purpose of this website is to increase a differential understanding about sentient experiences and causes of suffering. As suffering abolitionists we want to reduce the amount and the risk of unbearable suffering. Naturally, this involves increasing well being and sustainable bliss for all sentient beings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this website, we aim to foster an understanding of suffering and well being, by addressing important underlying mechanisms from both a biological and psychological perspective. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We hope to engage a community of suffering abolitionists and establish a productive and collaborative community-culture among goal-oriented people. To tackle the complex challenges on our hands, we believe that we need to grow diverse, resourceful and ambitious groups to work on many different cause areas of suffering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hopefully, together we will be able to apply thoughtful and effective problem-solving methodology and reduce suffering not just in the near but also distant future.</span></p>
