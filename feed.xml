<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main inspiration of the suffering abolition group is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pearce_(transhumanist)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">David Pearce</a>’s work on the topic. For many years he has been writing about and advocating for strategies to eradicate suffering in all sentient life. The abolition of suffering, he argues, is ambitious, but technically feasible. He continues: “Genetic engineering and nanotechnology allow Homo sapiens to discard the legacy-wetware of our evolutionary past. Our post-human successors will rewrite the vertebrate genome, redesign the global ecosystem, and abolish suffering throughout the living world.” (Pearce 1995) </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initiatives aiming to facilitate the eventual abolition of suffering can aim towards the goal directly or indirectly. Indirect initiatives would be such that build a scientific, educational and cultural foundation to help getting more direct interventions off the ground. Initiatives therefore can be very diverse, but they should fulfill multiple effectiveness and safety criteria such as the criteria of Scope/Importance, Tractability, and Neglectedness from <a href="https://concepts.effectivealtruism.org/concepts/importance-neglectedness-tractability/">Effective Altruism,</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/dac/evaluation/revised-evaluation-criteria-dec-2019.pdf">OECD DAC criteria</a>: Relevance, Coherence, Effectiveness, Efficiency, Impact, Sustainability (will the desired effects last), and reversibility criteria for particular innovative interventions in very complex systems, argued by the </span><a id="site-title" href="https://www.wildanimalinitiative.org/" data-animation-role="header-element" style="font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">Wild Animal Initiative.</a></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intervention mind map is for people, looking for ways to contribute to the cause. It gives a wide variation of ideas for engagement, for people who are rather new to suffering abolitionism and want to explore more, for people in a career exploration phase or for people with an already sophisticated professional background looking to contribute with their expertise. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interventions are not clustered by specific causes of suffering, like the one before, but by fields of expertise, interest and personal fit of potential contributors. These interventions are much more diverse, as there are much more ways to contribute to the mission than there are causes of suffering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note that assessing and prioritising personal fit are far more important than trying to make an objective initiative prioritisation (unless it is about funding): </span></p>
<p><strong>I'd advise anyone to try out as much as possible to learn about one's skills and weaknesses and how to utilise them, as well as what increases / decreases one’s motivation and well-being.</strong></p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #bad5d5;">Finding your niche of engagement: <br></span></strong><strong><span style="color: #bad5d5;">From first steps to career forming</span></strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help aspiring suffering abolitionists finding their niche of engagement, I group initiatives into five categories:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #a087b3;">1. Advocacy / Raising awareness / Education / Publicity</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #cfbd83;">2. Influencing policy making</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #aac78b;">3. Research</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #ba8484;">4. Capacity building</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #7e96d5;">5. Enterprises / institutions</span></p>
<h4><strong><span style="color: #a087b3;">1. Advocacy / Raising awareness / Education / Publicity</span></strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the following, it will be discussed how to increase the public’s and policy makers’ concern for sentient beings and their welfare. Ambitious and futuristic ideas are often experienced by the public as concerning or even threatening, despite their potential to increase health and wellbeing. Education and exposure (normalisation) can significantly increase acceptance of new welfare approaches for all sentient beings. But also open recognition of dangers and risks together with strategies to mitigate these risks are important to gain acceptance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are plenty of ways to increase awareness of suffering and increase support for suffering abolition. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Participating in or organising meetups<span style="font-weight: 400;"> helps to exchange ideas and increase understanding of and concern for discussed topics.</span>
<ul>
<li style="margin: 10px; font-weight: 400;" aria-level="3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For meetups and events, one could </span>prepare talks or workshops<span style="font-weight: 400;"> to raise awareness on the philosophy and moral importance of suffering abolition.</span></li>
<li style="margin: 10px; font-weight: 400;" aria-level="3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">T</span>alks can be as simple as a summary of already existing content.</li>
<li style="margin: 10px; font-weight: 400;" aria-level="3">To increase outreach, one might also <span style="font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit;">record more advanced meetups and events</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><span style="font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit;">share them via YouTube</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
<li style="margin: 10px; font-weight: 400;" aria-level="3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, one can </span>motivate joint work on high impact interventions<span style="font-weight: 400;"> or respective </span>career planning<span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></li>
<li style="margin: 10px; font-weight: 400;" aria-level="3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Groups and meetups to join can be about politics, effective altruism, animal rights and veganism, (trans-)humanism, anti-natalism and related topics. </span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">One can also </span>share resources <span style="font-weight: 400;">on online platforms, or via flyers that </span>raise awareness <span style="font-weight: 400;">on suffering, </span>encourage moral circle expansion<span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span>educate on interventions<span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>
<ul>
<li style="margin: 10px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">'Liking' respective material throughout social media increases traction and motivates the authors. Cross-post resources where there might be a relevant audience, such as other activist groups or organisations (e.g. political parties, NGOs and educational and youth groups). </span>If you have capacities, raise awareness about suffering abolition with your own work. Remember to avoid being spammy and always maintain an attitude of service, not demand or judgement.</li>
<li style="margin: 10px; font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another option could be starting or participating in </span>newsletters, with updates on projects <span style="font-weight: 400;">in the abolitionist community and with related news and opportunities. </span></li>
<li style="margin: 10px; font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">People can facilitate </span>translations of suffering abolitionist literature / articles<span style="font-weight: 400;">. A valuable resource to translate (including the audio version) would be “Can Biotechnology Abolish Suffering?” by David Pearce. </span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">People into </span>art and media<span style="font-weight: 400;"> could use their abilities to raise awareness and </span>influence cultural change<span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><br>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can foster such a change via illustrations, memes, stories, blogs, video clips, short films, music etc. by creating awareness and differential understanding of the suffering abolitionist values and approaches.</span>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Examples: Helping people become open minded about abolishing predation: Make / share compilations of (wild) carnivores befriended with their prey (see e.g. The Dodo’s series </span><a href="https://www.thedodo.com/series/odd-couples"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Odd Couples”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). Share them with the suffering abolition community and incorporate them in your presentations / campaigns.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="margin: 10px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An influential resource could also be an</span>(online) magazine<span style="font-weight: 400;">, covering topics related to suffering abolitionism / compassionate transhumanism via articles, news, opinion pieces and content from the community.<br>Format examples: <a href="https://www.wired.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wired</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.vox.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vox</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.freethink.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freethink</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span></a><a href="https://neo.life"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NEO.LIFE</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; </span> <br>Initiative example: Nil’s <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yD-qE4RVl0wbcbxuKjaC5lLMnZQXZfat6tcJyTjt17U/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">abolitionist magazine proposal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (please comment in the doc if you may be interested in moving the project forward!)</span></span></li>

<h4><strong><span style="font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; color: #cfbd83;">2. Influencing policy making </span></strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Policies influence society, including setting new norms and practises and defining what is a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">mal</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">practice. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even policies that don’t have immediate suffering abolitionist effects can greatly influence potential for (future) projects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the subsections below promising policy and lobbying ideas are listed.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="padding-bottom: 10px;">Promoting fertility control for ‘pests’, stray pets and wildlife: <br>The greatest potential for a compassionate, non-invasive, easily scalable, persistent and reversible approach to population control is fertility control. It should therefore be promoted as opposition to poisoning and predation against ‘pest’ or population control of wild animals. It not just reduces their burden on the environment, but also heavily reduces their struggle for resources. <span style="font-weight: 400;"> <br>A promising fertility control approach is immunocontraception. </span><br><br>Further Information on fertility control:

<li style="margin: 10px;">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To avoid abuse of and public distrust in according research, we need to implement an ethical code and an according research supervision system.

<li style="margin: 10px;">whether the research approach is ethical,</li>
<li style="margin: 10px;">whether research/technological enhancement is (potentially) valuable for the suffering abolition, and</li>

<li style="margin: 10px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technology </span><br>Research on technologies for environmental design and atmosphere regulation.

<li style="font-weight: 400; margin: 10px;" aria-level="3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talks can be as simple as a summary of already existing content.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400; margin: 10px;" aria-level="3">One might also record more advanced meetups and events and share them via YouTube to increase outreach.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400; margin: 10px;" aria-level="3">Furthermore, one can motivate joint work on high impact interventions or respective career planning. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400; margin: 10px;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Profession-specific networking and attending conferences can also increase capacity</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400; margin: 10px;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As can self-education and study groups, such as</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400; margin: 10px;" aria-level="3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reading groups</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400; margin: 10px;" aria-level="3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prioritisation discussions</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400; margin: 10px;" aria-level="3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finding a partner to read/watch relevant content together, or attend together events like talks and conferences, and discuss takeaways relevant to one’s own approach.</span></li>
<li style="margin: 10px;">Fundraising<br>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400; margin: 10px;" aria-level="2">One may start simply by using fundraising via FB during holidays, birthdays, match makers.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400; margin: 10px;" aria-level="2">For growing the capacity we also need funds, prizes and contests for (research) projects contributing to abolishing suffering.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="margin: 10px;">Job board<br>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400; margin: 10px;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A job &amp; volunteering board for aspiring abolitionists to build career capital and to contribute directly, similar to what have been established by </span><a href="https://80000hours.org/job-board/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">80,000 Hours</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.animaladvocacycareers.org/job-board"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Animal Advocacy Careers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="https://www.eawork.club/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EA Work Club</span></a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="margin: 10px;">Newsletter<br>Another option would be starting or participating in newsletters, with updates on projects <span style="font-weight: 400;">in the abolitionist community and with related news and opportunities. </span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><span style="color: #7e96d5;">5. Enterprises / institutions</span></strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is need of workforce in existing organisations as well as need for new start-ups and institutions. Well-organised, joint forces can have great global impact, as can be seen by institutions such as the UN or the World Health Organization. </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Existing organisations</strong><br></span>While there are few explicitly suffering abolitionist organisations, there are multiple organisations whose mission is at least partly aligned with the goal of reducing suffering and increasing wellbeing for all sentient beings. One can follow their work closely to have a better idea of their impact, and subscribe to their job postings to watch for opportunities matching one’s professional profile and personality.

<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Starting a new organisation</strong><br></span>A riskier and probably more demanding option - but one which can be much more impactful than joining an existing organisation - is to start a new organisation dedicated to abolition of suffering, more specifically.<br><br>If you are interested in starting a new enterprise/institution, you might check out:<br><a href="https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/" style="font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">Charity Entrepreneurship</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and their </span><a href="https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/post/a-guide-to-increasing-the-impact-of-your-research-by-involving-decision-makers" style="font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">guide to increase the impact of your research by involving decision-makers</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.<br><br></span>Example ideas of such organisations:
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400; margin: 10px;" aria-level="1">Advocacy, marketing, fundraising, and research on air cleaning technology: producing oxygen, reducing CO2 and pollution -&gt; making human quality of life independent of nature. See <a href="https://mechanicaltrees.com/mechanicaltrees/">MechanicalTrees</a> and examples <a href="https://qleanair.com/products/air-cleaners/qleanair-fs-10-carbon/">no. 1</a>, and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-air-purifiers-ncna1276411">no. 2</a>.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400; margin: 10px;" aria-level="1">Production and distribution / sale of non-invasive fertility control products for 'pests' and stray animals.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400; margin: 10px;" aria-level="1">A genetic health organisation for sentient beings, offering conferences, public image campaigns, networking with and lobbying policy makers, research and industry. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400; margin: 10px;" aria-level="1">A suffering abolition fund or prize: see e.g. the <a href="https://www.invinciblewellbeing.com/joshuacefalufund">fund by Invincible Wellbeing et al</a>. as well as Nil’s WIP draft on an abolitionist fund</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400; margin: 10px;" aria-level="1">An academic journal for suffering abolition related papers to evaluate (biotechnological) research papers in regard to their (potential) contribution to suffering abolition.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400; margin: 10px;" aria-level="1">A suffering research institute, see Robert Daoust’s <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cyDnDBxQKarKjeug2YJTv7XNTlVY-v9sQL45-Q2BFac">proposal for an “Institute for the Study of Suffering”</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As may be expected from entrepreneurship, one’s first serious attempts to start an abolitionist organisation are likely to "fail”: in the end there are many parts to a successful organisation, and just having a good idea is not enough. For example, one also needs a capable team with great culture to pull this off (networking and collaboration thus can be paramount).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such “failures” (including ones of others), however, are also an opportunity to learn so that one’s next attempt to establish an effective suffering abolitionist organisation is better informed and hence more likely to succeed. Other ways of gaining relevant experience include working in an existing organisation (not necessarily abolition-related) before starting a new one and signing up for an incubator program (see e.g. Charity Entrepreneurship’s incubation program aimed at establishing cost-effective intervention-focused charities).</span></p>

<p>First I mounted a ‘<strong>Disclaimer’ </strong>or intro box to the mindmap, indicating the purpose of the mind map, my professional background and my professional perspective on the topics.  </p>
<p><strong>In it, it says: </strong></p>
<p>The mind map was developed to give an overview on suffering cause areas and presumably most effective interventions.</p>
<p>The map should help aspiring suffering abolitionists to find their own niche of engagement.</p>
<p>And although my understanding comes from my education in Biology (B.Sc.) and Social Science (B.A.), as well as personal research, I am not an expert in all these topics. Therefore, I hope to ongoingly incorporate new insights, and discuss the maps with members of the scientific community in order to improve the framework.</p>

<p><strong>Let's define Suffering: </strong></p>
<p>When talking about suffering, what I mean by it is a desperate feeling coming from an extreme urge to stop an ongoing experience. It includes the following aspects:</p>
<p>- Strong aversion to the experience</p>
<p>- A perceived inability to avoid the experience</p>
<p>(this includes the inability to focus on positive aspects of the experience such as a potential reward, lesson or achievement)</p>
<p>- Subsequently, high stress level, often marked physiologically by fight, flight or freeze response</p>

<figure class="post__image">The <strong>ability to suffer</strong> depends on the ability to model a sense of experience and preference.</figure>
<p>According to my knowledge this requires a centralised computation system. By this understanding, the potential to suffer is plausible not just for <span style="color: #bad5d5;">human</span> and <span style="color: #afc7d8;">non-human</span> animals, but also for <span style="color: #e1991d;">digital sentience</span> as well as <span style="color: #a087b3;">extraterrestrial sentience</span>. </p>

<h2 class="post__image"><span style="color: #ba8484;"><strong>Forms of suffering - internal cause areas</strong></span></h2>
<p>Next, internal cause areas of suffering and different forms of suffering will be explored, based on understanding of human and non-human animals.</p>
<p>The first association and many other definitions of suffering are based on <strong>pain</strong>, and specifically physical pain. Pain has many different subcategories, which are all associated with physical injury due to internal physical malfunctions or due to outer forces such as ecological and environmental conditions or infectious diseases. Between physical pain and mental pain there is a subsection of <strong>chemical imbalance in the brain and general brain malfunctioning</strong>. I will not address the functionality of physical pain much more since it is comparably easy to understand intuitively.</p>
<p>More common than chemical imbalance in the brain and general brain malfunctioning, and yet less intuitively understood with their causal mechanisms than physical pain are mental pain responses, and subsequent mental health issues. Contrary to common intuitions, they seem to all come from <strong>unmet needs</strong>. To keep this part brief, I will restrain myself from going into the psychological mechanisms that alter our perception of mental discomfort and its causal factors. </p>
<p>I categorised these needs into the following categories and subcategories:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Safety</strong> associated needs, including
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">the need for one’s <strong>own physical and mental safety</strong></li>
<li aria-level="1">the need for the safety of <strong>valued things and entities</strong> </li>
<li aria-level="1">and the need for <strong>moral coherence and justice</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Physiological or self maintenance needs / feelings</strong>, like
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>hunger, thirst, breathing, and benign climate conditions</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1">Appropriate <strong>stimulation level</strong>. A lack of stimulation creates boredom and depression, and overstimulation induces overwhelm and even fear for safety. The stimulation homeostasis is required 
<ul>
<li aria-level="2">on a <strong>social, romantic and sexual stimulation level </strong></li>
<li aria-level="2">on perceived <strong>coherence </strong>of experiences, including 
<ul>
<li aria-level="3"><strong>comprehensibility</strong> of experiences. The notion of things happening in an orderly and predictable fashion and a sense that you can understand events in your life.  </li>
<li aria-level="3">The notion that one has the skills or ability, the support, the help, or the resources necessary to take care of things, and that things are <strong>manageable</strong> and within one’s control.</li>
<li aria-level="3">And the notion that one’s experiences, decisions and impact are <strong>meaningful </strong>and otherwise satisfactory.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="2">on the <strong>self actualisation</strong> level there are the need for self expression and <strong>a</strong><strong>esthetic preferences</strong></li>
<li aria-level="2">and on the <strong>esteem</strong> level there is a need for <strong>recognition and validation of one's self</strong>, one’s self-image and one’s experiences as well as of one’s <strong>accomplishments</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #aac78b;"><strong>Interventions for internal cause areas </strong><strong>- </strong><strong>Change of internal processes leading to suffering</strong></span></h3>
<p>In order to abolish suffering on an internal cause level, interventions have to change internal processes leading to suffering. </p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">The most sustainable interventions would be 
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><strong>Pre-birth genetic alteration</strong>: e.g. raised hedonic setpoint, enhanced conscious ability of emotional control, pain tolerance, compassion, open-mindedness, social skilfulness, etc.</li>
<li aria-level="2"><strong style="color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit;">Sentience prevention</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">External factors that change internal processes would be
<ul>
<li aria-level="2">Creating individualised optimal conditions for all sentient beings. This would only be possible through virtual reality, as the needs of beings are too diverse and thus conflicting with each other, leading to violation of some preferences either way, if conditions are optimised for any one preference system. </li>
<li aria-level="2">A much less radical and thus less effective and sustainable approach would be </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li aria-level="3"><strong>Sociological / cultural optimisation towards welfare for all sentient beings</strong></li>

<p>A major sustainability issue here is, if not combined with genetic interventions, that natural genetic diversification without selection pressure results in functionality decay that eventually can’t be compensated with external factors, such as education and welfare. Unfortunately, a common misconception is that genetic decay takes anywhere near as many generations as genetic adaptations with ‘gain of function mutations’. </p>
<p>There is, however, a very understandable reason behind avoiding this topic, as it may conjure up horrendous forms of eugenics and genocide on people with disabilities, as they happened in Nazi Germany and other parts of the world.  </p>
<p>Instead of acknowledging genetic factors as a source of privilege, people tend to value or devalue carriers for the presumable quality of their genes. I believe, however, avoiding or suppressing the topic altogether cannot be a response to the hatred against carriers of dysfunctional genes. Instead we should advocate for welfare that incorporates genetic engineering technologies as much as it includes classical medical care or social welfare.   </p>

<h2><span style="color: #ba8484;"><strong>External cause areas of suffering and potential interventions</strong></span></h2>
<p>In the next section external cause areas of suffering will be categorised, and specific interventions for these cause areas will be explored.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ba8484;"><strong>Exploitation</strong></span></p>
<p>Exploitation has many forms. The first associations that come to mind are abuse and slavery. But parasitism and carnism can also be considered forms of exploitation.</p>
<p>A newer form of exploitation is exploitation for information, known in the context of research on animals and potential digital sentience in the form of simulations.</p>
<p>Humans can be considered the most important target group as they are the most powerful exploiters. One potential <span style="color: #aac78b;">intervention</span> specific to humans, for example, is <span style="color: #aac78b;">education </span>and training in compassion towards all sentient beings. To ensure considerations towards all sentient beings empathy, social sensitivity, attentiveness (awareness), emotional control and open-mindedness need to be established through education and in the long run also through genetic interventions, at least to counterbalance genetic decay (see category <span style="color: #ba8484;">Natural Evolution</span> below ). Education has its limits though, and can only build on existing genetic factors.</p>
<p>So, for non-human animals and human animals a more sustainable intervention would be <span style="color: #aac78b;">genetic reprogramming</span>. To phase out exploitation we need to phase out survival dependency on exploitation - making all species physiologically independent from animal resources. Genetic engineering could also be used for enhancing genetic factors contributing to increased compassionate and well considered behaviour among all animals.</p>
<p>Behaviour mostly follows perceived needs, much more than actual physical needs. This is something we can observe for example in people struggling to switch to a vegan diet, not because of health reasons but because of the struggle to change habits and resist desires. </p>
<p>People and other exploitative species need the capacity to acknowledge conflicting needs, and a stable desire to prevent suffering of all parties. Only then they are able in cases of conflicting needs to work on compromises instead of exploitation, destructive conflicts or competition. Neurobiologically, the reward circuit response to the process and achievement of compromise needs to be stronger than the one for achieving profit at the costs of others. </p>
<p>Natural evolutionary processes give rise to selfish and tribal strategies, as well as more globally considered strategies. It is evident that selfish and tribal genetic adaptations have better short and medium term success rates. In order to establish a globally considered community genetic factors for strong positive reward circuit responses to the process and achievement of optimal outcomes for all sentient beings need to be widely spread. At the same time the pleasure in truth finding always has to outweigh the painfulness of facing unwanted truths. The neurobiological possibilities of education and training (re-conditioning) are powerful, but not able to phase out exploitation on their own.    </p>
<p>Now, common arguments against reprogramming interventions are that ecological systems are just too complex and the sheer amount of involved sentient beings, especially if we assume at least some degree of sentience in insects. I agree with this, but also add that wild habitats are suffering hazards that should not exist. While genetic programming interventions need rigorous testing on a small scale, leaving hazardous environments uncared for is irresponsible, and life proliferation in those environments should be avoided as long as exploitation is the standard way of survival and until welfare of all sentient beings is feasible and implemented.</p>
<p>To prevent a sense of loss and increase support among humans (i.e. the one species of great influence), a <span style="color: #aac78b;">shift to controlled virtual existence</span> could compensate for the loss of nature in its raw and unmodified form. Non-sentient simulations there can be harmed and exploited in the usual ways, without causing real suffering. And if “mind uploading” could ever be possible, ensuring welfare and safety in those digital worlds should be much easier than welfare and safety for biological systems.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ba8484;"><strong>Malevolence from others (intend to harm/create suffering)</strong></span></p>
<p>The desire to harm others, without creating immediate profit for oneself or others, can have many different causes: envy, unprocessed pain and trauma, feeling easily threatened due to lack of self worth, accepting a negative image and persona others projected onto you, showing off power over others, believing compassion to be a weakness and so on.   </p>
<p>There are important interventions to prevent malevolence such as identification and exclusion from powerful positions, rehabilitation and improved childcare. However, once again, in the long run these interventions should be combined with genetic interventions that eliminate risk factors for unhealthy emotional vulnerability and with genetic interventions that ensure genetic factors for compassion and emotional control. </p>
<p><span style="color: #ba8484;"><strong>Unintended Harm</strong></span></p>
<p>Next category is causing unintended harm. </p>
<p>(a) Harm is often done due to<span style="color: #ba8484;"> discriminating moral circles</span>, i.e. lack of empathy for other groups like beings outside one’s own family, circle of friends, ethnic group or species. Discriminating moral circles lead to ignorance when excluded sentient beings get negatively affected. </p>
<p>(b) There are also cognitive reasons for a <span style="color: #ba8484;">lack of empathy, compassion and understanding</span>. Often enough good intentions are badly executed and create more harm than good.</p>
<p>(c) Lastly, significant harm can be caused by <span style="color: #ba8484;">corrupted 'good intentions' with ulterior motives</span>.</p>
<p>Good intentions can be corrupted by </p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">the desire to be needed, creating dependencies rather than solutions</li>
<li aria-level="1">caring more for the image gain or self esteem boost than the cause, leading to poorly developed solutions, intransparency and suppression of valid criticism </li>
<li aria-level="1">narcissistic needs and desires to control others (through paternalism, for example) </li>
</ul>
<p>(Note that boosting one's motivation for altruistic projects by incorporating other needs is useful when done in a self-aware, reflected and balanced way.)</p>
<p><span style="color: #aac78b;">Interventions</span> against unintended harm are again similar to those against exploitation and malevolence, based on <span style="color: #aac78b;">education</span> and <span style="color: #aac78b;">genetic interventions</span>. </p>
<p><span style="color: #aac78b;">Educational approaches </span>would contain training in rational and goal focussed thinking, self reflection and self awareness, as well as reading and positively influencing sentience, and compassion.</p>
<p><span style="color: #aac78b;">Genetic reprogramming</span> would involve enhancing genetic factors that facilitate the development of empathy, social sensitivity, scope sensitivity (awareness), emotional control, compassion and open-mindedness.  </p>
<p><span style="color: #ba8484;"><strong>Natural Evolution</strong></span></p>
<p>The next category is natural evolution. The way it causes suffering is through <span style="color: #ba8484;">excessive reproduction rates</span>. Excess of offspring and thus gene carriers is needed as a basis for selection processes. Which again only works in favour of evolutionary processes if most of the offspring lose the fight for survival. It is a game with a predetermined ever same goal: to secure the survival of at least part of the offspring. The evolution game has many victims and even ‘winning’ doesn’t mean safety and protection against suffering.</p>
<p>An <span style="color: #aac78b;">intervention</span> targeting the downsides of natural evolution needs to<span style="color: #aac78b;"> reduce death and reproduction rates</span>. The genetically imprinted desires that lead to reproduction need to be addressed (especially once death becomes avoidable through medical advances).</p>
<p>The other part of natural evolution is <span style="color: #ba8484;">gene-diversification through mutations and recombination</span>. Statistically only the tiniest minority of genetic alterations is expected to benefit the carrier, while the vast majority is either useless or harmful to it’s carrier. Therefore, any ‘gain-of-function’ mutation requires many victims with destructive genetic alterations, and disadvantages in the fight for survival.</p>
<p>A compassionate approach is <span style="color: #aac78b;">replacing competitive evolutionary strategy with reproduction control and pre-birth genetic optimisation</span>. Most human societies have successfully fought the harsh selection conditions that are demanded for evolutionary progress. But unfortunately without addressing over-reproduction and constant gene diversification we are facing dead-end problems. In natural evolution gene diversification is needed to generate adaptability to an ever changing environment. Luckily, wealth and access to reproduction control have so far stabilised most human populations. But without addressing constant gene diversification we not just lose the ability to adapt and progress as a species, but are facing genetic decay. And genetic decay through loss of selection pressure is in fact a fast process. For reference see:</p>

<p><span style="color: #ba8484;"><strong>Environmental / Physical Factors</strong></span></p>
<p>Environmental / Physical Factors are another external cause of suffering. Particularly liable to suffering are extreme changes of environment, caused among other things by climate changes, as well as terrestrial and ecological shifts. </p>
<p>Such changes lead to both an <span style="color: #ba8484;">inability to adapt as an individual </span>and <span style="color: #ba8484;">accidents</span>. Even if species or populations survive and recover from changes in the environment or are able to co-evolve with their sources of nutrition, their competitors, predators, parasites and infectious diseases, these ecological dynamics entail suffering and death for the majority of the involved individuals. In fact, for individuals even minor changes, like those of normal seasons, can be hard to compensate for and thus cause severe suffering.</p>
<p>To address the hardships of individuals, we need to establish <span style="color: #aac78b;">welfare for all sentient beings</span>, as well as <span style="color: #aac78b;">compassionate environment design </span>adapted to the needs of sentient ​​inhabitants.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ba8484;"><strong>Limit of Resources / Competition / Exceeded reproduction rate due to natural evolution</strong></span></p>
<p>At last, as already indicated in other categories, significant causes of suffering are <span style="color: #ba8484;">limited resources, competition and exceeding reproduction rates</span>. These causes are heavily interconnected and thus named together. The intuitive human response is <span style="color: #aac78b;">increasing</span> <span style="color: #aac78b;">efficiency of resource use and production</span>. But even technological advances in efficiency can not always compensate for the increase of demand due to population growth. If possible, a <span style="color: #aac78b;">shift to virtual existence</span> with total control over resources could be a solution. Otherwise <span style="color: #aac78b;">population control </span>through <span style="color: #aac78b;">fertility reduction</span> is necessary to reduce competition and overuse of resources. Also <span style="color: #aac78b;">reduction of habitats with uncontrolled life proliferation </span>might be worth considering as long as feasibility and capacity of welfare is limited. </p>

<p><strong>About Interventions</strong></p>
<p>Note that intervention when implemented naively can easily cause severe counter effects!</p>
<p>Cause areas need to be well understood to target the real cause, and not indicators of a cause.</p>
<p>Interventions need to be well thought through with thorough assessment of potential intermediate and long-term outcomes (incl. side-effects) and impact.</p>

                <h2>How about we abolish suffering?</h2>
<p>The purpose of this website is to increase a differential understanding about sentient experiences and causes of suffering. As suffering abolitionists we want to reduce the amount and the risk of unbearable suffering. Naturally, this involves increasing well-being and sustainable bliss for all sentient beings.</p>
<p>With this website, we aim to foster an understanding of suffering and well-being, by addressing important underlying mechanisms from both a biological and psychological perspective. </p>
<p>We hope to engage a community of suffering abolitionists and establish a productive and collaborative community-culture among goal-oriented people. To tackle the complex challenges on our hands, we believe that we need to grow diverse, resourceful and ambitious groups to work on many different cause areas of suffering.</p>
<p>Hopefully, together we will be able to apply thoughtful and effective problem-solving methodology and reduce suffering not just in the near but also distant future.</p>
