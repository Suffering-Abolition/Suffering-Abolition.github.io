Pain has many different subcategories, which are all associated with physical injury due to internal physical malfunctions or due to outer forces such as ecological and environmental conditions or infectious diseases. Between physical pain and mental pain there is a subsection of <strong>chemical imbalance in the brain and general brain malfunctioning</strong>. I will not address the functionality of physical pain much more since it is comparably easy to understand intuitively.</p><p>More common than chemical imbalance in the brain and general brain malfunctioning, and yet less intuitively understood with their causal mechanisms than physical pain are mental pain responses, and subsequent mental health issues. Contrary to common intuitions, they seem to all come from <strong>unmet needs</strong>. To keep this part brief, I will restrain myself from going into the psychological mechanisms that alter our perception of mental discomfort and its causal factors. </p><p>I categorised these needs into the following categories and subcategories:</p><ul><li aria-level="1"><strong>Safety</strong> associated needs, including<ul><li aria-level="1">the need for one’s <strong>own physical and mental safety</strong></li><li aria-level="1">the need for the safety of <strong>valued things and entities</strong> </li><li aria-level="1">and the need for <strong>moral coherence and justice</strong></li></ul></li><li aria-level="1"><strong>Physiological or self maintenance needs / feelings</strong>, like<ul><li aria-level="1"><strong>hunger, thirst, breathing, and benign climate conditions</strong></li></ul></li><li aria-level="1">Appropriate <strong>stimulation level</strong>. A lack of stimulation creates boredom and depression, and overstimulation induces overwhelm and even fear for safety. The stimulation homeostasis is required <ul><li aria-level="2">on a <strong>social, romantic and sexual stimulation level </strong></li><li aria-level="2">on perceived <strong>coherence </strong>of experiences, including <ul><li aria-level="3"><strong>comprehensibility</strong> of experiences. The notion of things happening in an orderly and predictable fashion and a sense that you can understand events in your life.  </li><li aria-level="3">The notion that one has the skills or ability, the support, the help, or the resources necessary to take care of things, and that things are <strong>manageable</strong> and within one’s control.</li><li aria-level="3">And the notion that one’s experiences, decisions and impact are <strong>meaningful </strong>and otherwise satisfactory.</li></ul></li><li aria-level="2">on the <strong>self actualisation</strong> level there are the need for self expression and <strong>a</strong><strong>esthetic preferences</strong></li><li aria-level="2">and on the <strong>esteem</strong> level there is a need for <strong>recognition and validation of one's self</strong>, one’s self-image and one’s experiences as well as of one’s <strong>accomplishments</strong></li></ul></li></ul><h3><span style="color: #aac78b;"><strong>Interventions for internal cause areas </strong><strong>- </strong><strong>Change of internal processes leading to suffering</strong></span></h3><p>In order to abolish suffering on an internal cause level, interventions have to change internal processes leading to suffering. </p><ul><li aria-level="1">The most sustainable interventions would be <ul><li aria-level="2"><strong>Pre-birth genetic alteration</strong>: e.g. raised hedonic setpoint, enhanced conscious ability of emotional control, pain tolerance, compassion, open-mindedness, social skilfulness, etc.</li><li aria-level="2"><strong style="color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit;">Sentience prevention</strong></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li aria-level="1">External factors that change internal processes would be<ul><li aria-level="2">Creating individualised optimal conditions for all sentient beings. This would only be possible through virtual reality, as the needs of beings are too diverse and thus conflicting with each other, leading to violation of some preferences either way, if conditions are optimised for any one preference system. </li><li aria-level="2">A much less radical and thus less effective and sustainable approach would be </li></ul></li></ul><ul><li style="list-style-type: none;"><ul><li style="list-style-type: none;"><ul><li aria-level="3"><strong>Sociological / cultural optimisation towards welfare for all sentient beings</strong></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li style="list-style-type: none;"><ul><li style="list-style-type: none;"><ul><li aria-level="3"><strong>Optimised education and training for rational thinking, life-skills, resilience and compassion</strong></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>A major sustainability issue here is, if not combined with genetic interventions, that natural genetic diversification without selection pressure results in functionality decay that eventually can’t be compensated with external factors, such as education and welfare. Unfortunately, a common misconception is that genetic decay takes anywhere near as many generations as genetic adaptations with ‘gain of function mutations’. </p><p>There is, however, a very understandable reason behind avoiding this topic, as it may conjure up horrendous forms of eugenics and genocide on people with disabilities, as they happened in Nazi Germany and other parts of the world.  </p><p>Instead of acknowledging genetic factors as a source of privilege, people tend to value or devalue carriers for the presumable quality of their genes. I believe, however, avoiding or suppressing the topic altogether cannot be a response to the hatred against carriers of dysfunctional genes. Instead we should advocate for welfare that incorporates genetic engineering technologies as much as it includes classical medical care or social welfare.   </p><figure class="is-loaded"><img loading="lazy" src="https://suffering-abolition.github.io/media/posts/2/5_Website_Mindmap_Numbers.png" data-is-external-image="true" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://Suffering-Abolition.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/5_Website_Mindmap_Numbers-xs.png 300w, https://Suffering-Abolition.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/5_Website_Mindmap_Numbers-sm.png 480w, https://Suffering-Abolition.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/5_Website_Mindmap_Numbers-md.png 768w, https://Suffering-Abolition.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/5_Website_Mindmap_Numbers-lg.png 1024w, https://Suffering-Abolition.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/5_Website_Mindmap_Numbers-xl.png 1360w, https://Suffering-Abolition.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/5_Website_Mindmap_Numbers-2xl.png 1600w" alt="" width="90" height="96" loading="lazy"></figure><h2><span style="color: #ba8484;"><strong>External cause areas of suffering and potential interventions</strong></span></h2><p>In the next section external cause areas of suffering will be categorised, and specific interventions for these cause areas will be explored.</p><p><span style="color: #ba8484;"><strong>Exploitation</strong></span></p><p>Exploitation has many forms. The first associations that come to mind are abuse and slavery. But parasitism and carnism can also be considered forms of exploitation.</p><p>A newer form of exploitation is exploitation for information, known in the context of research on animals and potential digital sentience in the form of simulations.</p><p>Humans can be considered the most important target group as they are the most powerful exploiters. One potential <span style="color: #aac78b;">intervention</span> specific to humans, for example, is <span style="color: #aac78b;">education </span>and training in compassion towards all sentient beings. To ensure considerations towards all sentient beings empathy, social sensitivity, attentiveness (awareness), emotional control and open-mindedness need to be established through education and in the long run also through genetic interventions, at least to counterbalance genetic decay (see category <span style="color: #ba8484;">Natural Evolution</span> below ). Education has its limits though, and can only build on existing genetic factors.</p><p>So, for non-human animals and human animals a more sustainable intervention would be <span style="color: #aac78b;">genetic reprogramming</span>. To phase out exploitation we need to phase out survival dependency on exploitation - making all species physiologically independent from animal resources. Genetic engineering could also be used for enhancing genetic factors contributing to increased compassionate and well considered behaviour among all animals.</p><p>Behaviour mostly follows perceived needs, much more than actual physical needs. This is something we can observe for example in people struggling to switch to a vegan diet, not because of health reasons but because of the struggle to change habits and resist desires. </p><p>People and other exploitative species need the capacity to acknowledge conflicting needs, and a stable desire to prevent suffering of all parties. Only then they are able in cases of conflicting needs to work on compromises instead of exploitation, destructive conflicts or competition. Neurobiologically, the reward circuit response to the process and achievement of compromise needs to be stronger than the one for achieving profit at the costs of others. </p><p>Natural evolutionary processes give rise to selfish and tribal strategies, as well as more globally considered strategies. It is evident that selfish and tribal genetic adaptations have better short and medium term success rates. In order to establish a globally considered community genetic factors for strong positive reward circuit responses to the process and achievement of optimal outcomes for all sentient beings need to be widely spread. At the same time the pleasure in truth finding always has to outweigh the painfulness of facing unwanted truths. The neurobiological possibilities of education and training (re-conditioning) are powerful, but not able to phase out exploitation on their own.    </p><p>Now, common arguments against reprogramming interventions are that ecological systems are just too complex and the sheer amount of involved sentient beings, especially if we assume at least some degree of sentience in insects. I agree with this, but also add that wild habitats are suffering hazards that should not exist. While genetic programming interventions need rigorous testing on a small scale, leaving hazardous environments uncared for is irresponsible, and life proliferation in those environments should be avoided as long as exploitation is the standard way of survival and until welfare of all sentient beings is feasible and implemented.</p><p>To prevent a sense of loss and increase support among humans (i.e. the one species of great influence), a <span style="color: #aac78b;">shift to controlled virtual existence</span> could compensate for the loss of nature in its raw and unmodified form. Non-sentient simulations there can be harmed and exploited in the usual ways, without causing real suffering. And if “mind uploading” could ever be possible, ensuring welfare and safety in those digital worlds should be much easier than welfare and safety for biological systems.</p><p><span style="color: #ba8484;"><strong>Malevolence from others (intend to harm/create suffering)</strong></span></p><p>The desire to harm others, without creating immediate profit for oneself or others, can have many different causes: envy, unprocessed pain and trauma, feeling easily threatened due to lack of self worth, accepting a negative image and persona others projected onto you, showing off power over others, believing compassion to be a weakness and so on.   </p><p>There are important interventions to prevent malevolence such as identification and exclusion from powerful positions, rehabilitation and improved childcare. However, once again, in the long run these interventions should be combined with genetic interventions that eliminate risk factors for unhealthy emotional vulnerability and with genetic interventions that ensure genetic factors for compassion and emotional control. </p><p><span style="color: #ba8484;"><strong>Unintended Harm</strong></span></p><p>Next category is causing unintended harm. </p><p>(a) Harm is often done due to<span style="color: #ba8484;"> discriminating moral circles</span>, i.e. lack of empathy for other groups like beings outside one’s own family, circle of friends, ethnic group or species. Discriminating moral circles lead to ignorance when excluded sentient beings get negatively affected. </p><p>(b) There are also cognitive reasons for a <span style="color: #ba8484;">lack of empathy, compassion and understanding</span>. Often enough good intentions are badly executed and create more harm than good.</p><p>(c) Lastly, significant harm can be caused by <span style="color: #ba8484;">corrupted 'good intentions' with ulterior motives</span>.</p><p>Good intentions can be corrupted by </p><ul><li aria-level="1">the desire to be needed, creating dependencies rather than solutions</li><li aria-level="1">caring more for the image gain or self esteem boost than the cause, leading to poorly developed solutions, intransparency and suppression of valid criticism </li><li aria-level="1">narcissistic needs and desires to control others (through paternalism, for example) </li></ul><p>(Note that boosting one's motivation for altruistic projects by incorporating other needs is useful when done in a self-aware, reflected and balanced way.)</p><p><span style="color: #aac78b;">Interventions</span> against unintended harm are again similar to those against exploitation and malevolence, based on <span style="color: #aac78b;">education</span> and <span style="color: #aac78b;">genetic interventions</span>. </p><p><span style="color: #aac78b;">Educational approaches </span>would contain training in rational and goal focussed thinking, self reflection and self awareness, as well as reading and positively influencing sentience, and compassion.</p><p><span style="color: #aac78b;">Genetic reprogramming</span> would involve enhancing genetic factors that facilitate the development of empathy, social sensitivity, scope sensitivity (awareness), emotional control, compassion and open-mindedness.  </p><p><span style="color: #ba8484;"><strong>Natural Evolution</strong></span></p><p>The next category is natural evolution. The way it causes suffering is through <span style="color: #ba8484;">excessive reproduction rates</span>. Excess of offspring and thus gene carriers is needed as a basis for selection processes. Which again only works in favour of evolutionary processes if most of the offspring lose the fight for survival. It is a game with a predetermined ever same goal: to secure the survival of at least part of the offspring. The evolution game has many victims and even ‘winning’ doesn’t mean safety and protection against suffering.</p><p>An <span style="color: #aac78b;">intervention</span> targeting the downsides of natural evolution needs to<span style="color: #aac78b;"> reduce death and reproduction rates</span>. The genetically imprinted desires that lead to reproduction need to be addressed (especially once death becomes avoidable through medical advances).</p><p>The other part of natural evolution is <span style="color: #ba8484;">gene-diversification through mutations and recombination</span>. Statistically only the tiniest minority of genetic alterations is expected to benefit the carrier, while the vast majority is either useless or harmful to it’s carrier. Therefore, any ‘gain-of-function’ mutation requires many victims with destructive genetic alterations, and disadvantages in the fight for survival.</p><p>A compassionate approach is <span style="color: #aac78b;">replacing competitive evolutionary strategy with reproduction control and pre-birth genetic optimisation</span>. Most human societies have successfully fought the harsh selection conditions that are demanded for evolutionary progress. But unfortunately without addressing over-reproduction and constant gene diversification we are facing dead-end problems. In natural evolution gene diversification is needed to generate adaptability to an ever changing environment. Luckily, wealth and access to reproduction control have so far stabilised most human populations. But without addressing constant gene diversification we not just lose the ability to adapt and progress as a species, but are facing genetic decay. And genetic decay through loss of selection pressure is in fact a fast process. For reference see:</p><p>Lynch, M. (2016).

Particularly liable to suffering are extreme changes of environment, caused among other things by climate changes, as well as terrestrial and ecological shifts. </p><p>Such changes lead to both an <span style="color: #ba8484;">inability to adapt as an individual </span>and <span style="color: #ba8484;">accidents</span>. Even if species or populations survive and recover from changes in the environment or are able to co-evolve with their sources of nutrition, their competitors, predators, parasites and infectious diseases, these ecological dynamics entail suffering and death for the majority of the involved individuals. In fact, for individuals even minor changes, like those of normal seasons, can be hard to compensate for and thus cause severe suffering.</p><p>To address the hardships of individuals, we need to establish <span style="color: #aac78b;">welfare for all sentient beings</span>, as well as <span style="color: #aac78b;">compassionate environment design </span>adapted to the needs of sentient ​​inhabitants.</p><p><span style="color: #ba8484;"><strong>Limit of Resources / Competition / Exceeded reproduction rate due to natural evolution</strong></span></p><p>At last, as already indicated in other categories, significant causes of suffering are <span style="color: #ba8484;">limited resources, competition and exceeding reproduction rates</span>. These causes are heavily interconnected and thus named together. The intuitive human response is <span style="color: #aac78b;">increasing</span> <span style="color: #aac78b;">efficiency of resource use and production</span>. But even technological advances in efficiency can not always compensate for the increase of demand due to population growth. If possible, a <span style="color: #aac78b;">shift to virtual existence</span> with total control over resources could be a solution. Otherwise <span style="color: #aac78b;">population control </span>through <span style="color: #aac78b;">fertility reduction</span> is necessary to reduce competition and overuse of resources. Also <span style="color: #aac78b;">reduction of habitats with uncontrolled life proliferation </span>might be worth considering as long as feasibility and capacity of welfare is limited. </p><figure class="is-loaded"><img loading="lazy" src="https://suffering-abolition.github.io/media/posts/2/6_Website_Mindmap_Numbers.png" data-is-external-image="true" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://Suffering-Abolition.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/6_Website_Mindmap_Numbers-xs.png 300w, https://Suffering-Abolition.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/6_Website_Mindmap_Numbers-sm.png 480w, https://Suffering-Abolition.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/6_Website_Mindmap_Numbers-md.png 768w, https://Suffering-Abolition.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/6_Website_Mindmap_Numbers-lg.png 1024w, https://Suffering-Abolition.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/6_Website_Mindmap_Numbers-xl.png 1360w, https://Suffering-Abolition.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/6_Website_Mindmap_Numbers-2xl.png 1600w" alt="" width="90" height="96" loading="lazy"></figure><p><strong>About Interventions</strong></p><p>Note that intervention when implemented naively can easily cause severe counter effects!</p><p>Cause areas need to be well understood to target the real cause, and not indicators of a cause.</p><p>Interventions need to be well thought through with thorough assessment of potential intermediate and long-term outcomes (incl. side-effects) and impact.</p><figure class="is-loaded"><img loading="lazy" src="https://suffering-abolition.github.io/media/posts/2/7_Website_Mindmap_Numbers.png" data-is-external-image="true" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://Suffering-Abolition.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/7_Website_Mindmap_Numbers-xs.png 300w, https://Suffering-Abolition.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/7_Website_Mindmap_Numbers-sm.png 480w, https://Suffering-Abolition.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/7_Website_Mindmap_Numbers-md.png 768w, https://Suffering-Abolition.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/7_Website_Mindmap_Numbers-lg.png 1024w, https://Suffering-Abolition.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/7_Website_Mindmap_Numbers-xl.png 1360w, https://Suffering-Abolition.github.io/media/posts/2/responsive/7_Website_Mindmap_Numbers-2xl.png 1600w" alt="" width="90" height="96" loading="lazy"></figure><p>Please, now follow the link to find initiatives specified according to areas of education, and niche of engagement in the <strong><a href="https://suffering-abolition.github.io/intervention-mindmap-against-suffering/">Intervention Mindmap against Suffering</a></strong></p><p> </p><div class="wrapper post__entry"><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #95a5a6;">This article was fist published on 04 Mar 2022.
